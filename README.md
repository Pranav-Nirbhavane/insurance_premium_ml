# **ðŸ’¸ Predicting the premium for insurance using Machine Learning**

In this notebook, we are going through a machine learning project with the goal of predicting the premium to be paid for insurance.

# **1. Problem Defination**
> The objectives of this project is to predict insurance premiums based on various factors.

# **2. Data**

> The data is downloaded from the kaggle playground prediction competition:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e12

> For this competition, you are predicting the premium of insurance for customers.

# **3. Evaluation**
> The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted premiums.

For more on the evaluation for the project check the below link.

**Note:** The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error.
